IPv6 Post Installation Procedures
=================================

Congratulations, you have completed the setup of using a service VM to act as an IPv6 vRouter.
You have validated the setup based on the instruction in previous sections. If you want to further
test your setup, you can ``ping6`` among ``VM1``, ``VM2``, ``vRouter`` and ``ipv6-router``.

This setup allows further open innovation by any 3rd-party. For more instructions and documentations,
