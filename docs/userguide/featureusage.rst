Using IPv6 Feature of Colorado Release
======================================

This section provides the users with gap analysis regarding IPv6 feature requirements with
OpenStack Mitaka Official Release and Open Daylight Boron Official Release. The gap analysis
serves as feature specific user guides and references when as a user you may leverage the
IPv6 feature in the platform and need to perform some IPv6 related operations.

IPv6 Gap Analysis with OpenStack Mitaka
***************************************

This section provides users with IPv6 gap analysis regarding feature requirement with
OpenStack Neutron in Mitaka Official Release. The following table lists the use cases / feature
requirements of VIM-agnostic IPv6 functionality, including infrastructure layer and VNF
(VM) layer, and its gap analysis with OpenStack Neutron in Mitaka Official Release.

IPv6 Gap Analysis with Open Daylight Boron
******************************************

This section provides users with IPv6 gap analysis regarding feature requirement with
Open Daylight Boron Official Release. The following table lists the use cases / feature
requirements of VIM-agnostic IPv6 functionality, including infrastructure layer and VNF
(VM) layer, and its gap analysis with Open Daylight Boron Official Release.

**Open Daylight Boron Status**

There are 2 options in Open Daylight Boron to provide Virtualized Networks:

1 ''Old Netvirt'': netvirt implementation used in Open Daylight Beryllium Release
  identified by feature ''odl-ovsdb-openstack''

2 ''New Netvirt'': netvirt implementation which will replace the Old Netvirt in the future
  releases based on a more modular design. It is identified by feature ''odl-netvirt-openstack''
